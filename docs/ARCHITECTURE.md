# Architecture

## Overview

Archimedes Agent is currently a client-heavy Tauri/Vite application. The Rust/Tauri layer provides the desktop shell, while the React frontend owns the diagram editor, assistant UI, local persistence, and Ollama communication.

## Main runtime components

### `src/App.tsx`

`App.tsx` is the main orchestrator. It owns:

- settings state;
- chat messages;
- current Excalidraw snapshot ref;
- persistence timers;
- proactive-review timers;
- Ollama request lifecycle;
- assistant message streaming updates.

Important implementation detail: diagram changes are stored in a React ref, not normal React state. Excalidraw emits frequent `onChange` events. Keeping every scene update in React state caused maximum-update-depth loops, so the latest diagram snapshot is now stored in `snapshotRef` and persisted on a debounce.

### `src/components/DiagramCanvas.tsx`

This wraps the Excalidraw React component.

Responsibilities:

- import Excalidraw and its CSS;
- pass memoized `initialData` from local storage;
- expose the Excalidraw imperative API to the parent;
- emit sanitized snapshots on scene change.

The Excalidraw container must have non-zero height. The CSS sets the diagram pane and canvas to full viewport height.

### `src/components/AssistantPanel.tsx`

The assistant panel is a right-side UI for:

- showing model/status text;
- displaying chat/review messages;
- sending user prompts;
- triggering manual diagram review;
- changing settings;
- testing Ollama connectivity;
- clearing chat.

It does not call Ollama directly. It delegates to callbacks from `App.tsx`.

### `src/lib/diagramImage.ts`

Exports the current Excalidraw scene to an image.

Flow:

1. Filter deleted elements.
2. Call Excalidraw `exportToBlob`.
3. Export as PNG by default.
4. Convert Blob to base64.
5. Return `{ base64, mimeType, summary }`.

This base64 string is sent to Ollama without a `data:image/png;base64,` prefix.

### `src/lib/diagramSummary.ts`

Produces small secondary text context for the model.

Current summary includes:

- live element count;
- text labels;
- arrows and bindings;
- group counts;
- unlabeled component count;
- a small list of obvious unlabeled component IDs.

This is intentionally not the full Excalidraw JSON. The model primarily receives the image.

### `src/lib/llm/ollama.ts`

Ollama client for local HTTP calls.

Current capabilities:

- `streamOllamaChat` posts to `/api/chat`;
- supports `messages[].images` payloads;
- parses newline-delimited streaming JSON;
- appends streamed tokens via callback;
- `testOllamaConnection` calls `/api/tags` and checks selected model metadata.

Request shape:

```json
{
  "model": "gemma4:e4b",
  "stream": true,
  "options": { "temperature": 0.3 },
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "..." },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Review this architecture diagram...",
      "images": ["<base64-png>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `src/lib/llm/prompts.ts`

Defines the assistant's behavior.

The system prompt tells the model to:

- act as a collaborative architecture brainstorming partner;
- inspect the diagram image first;
- ask clarifying questions;
- identify risks, assumptions, bottlenecks, and tradeoffs;
- be concise for proactive reviews;
- admit uncertainty when the diagram is unclear.

### `src/lib/storage.ts`

Simple localStorage persistence.

Keys:

- `archimedes-agent.settings.v1`
- `archimedes-agent.scene.v1`
- `archimedes-agent.chat.v1`

A bug was fixed where array fallbacks were incorrectly object-spread. Arrays now remain arrays when loaded.

## Image capture timing

Images are exported only when an agent request is about to be made:

1. User clicks **Review diagram**.
2. User sends a chat message.
3. Proactive review fires after meaningful scene change + inactivity.

The app does not continuously screenshot or stream frames.

## Proactive review algorithm

A proactive review is scheduled only after a meaningful scene signature change.

Current logic:

1. Excalidraw `onChange` emits a snapshot.
2. App builds a scene signature using element IDs, type, position, size, version, and text.
3. If signature changed, reset the inactivity timer.
4. If auto-review is enabled, schedule a review after `proactiveDelayMs`.
5. Before sending, check:
   - not already busy;
   - enough live elements;
   - cooldown has elapsed.
6. Export current image and call Ollama.

Defaults:

```ts
proactiveDelayMs: 12_000
proactiveCooldownMs: 60_000
```

If nothing changes after the previous screenshot, no new proactive screenshot is sent.

## Local persistence model

Persistence is currently browser/webview localStorage. This is good enough for a prototype, but later versions should move to proper file/project storage through Tauri APIs.

Current persisted data:

- latest diagram scene snapshot;
- assistant chat messages;
- settings and proactive-review preferences.

## Tauri layer

Tauri v2 is scaffolded in `src-tauri/`.

Current Rust layer is minimal:

- initializes Tauri;
- installs `tauri-plugin-opener`;
- opens one main window;
- delegates nearly all behavior to the frontend.

`tauri.conf.json` sets:

- product name: `Archimedes Agent`;
- dev URL: `http://localhost:1420`;
- frontend dist: `../dist`;
- window size: 1400x900;
- CSP: `null` for now.

## Privacy and network boundaries

By default, network calls go only to:

```txt
http://localhost:11434
```

The user can edit the endpoint. If they set a remote endpoint, exported diagram images and prompts will be sent there.

No cloud LLM integration exists in the codebase.

## Current build status

- `npm run build` passes.
- Browser dev mode works.
- Local image-understanding tests with Ollama image understanding succeeded.
- Tauri packaging has not been completed in this environment.

## Architectural risks / future improvements

- Move persistence from localStorage to project files or SQLite.
- Add explicit diagram export/import.
- Add cancellation UI for long model calls.
- Add model capability diagnostics in settings.
- Add chunk splitting/manual chunks for bundle size.
- Harden Tauri CSP for production.
- Add E2E tests for canvas export and Ollama mocks.
- Support two-model workflow: vision model describes image, reasoning model critiques architecture.
